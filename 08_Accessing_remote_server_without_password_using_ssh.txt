	Make sure ssh is installed in your computer (type ssh and hit enter)

step-01 : ssh-keygen    (type this command and hit enter)

This command will ask for few informations like enter the directory name where you want to save the keys , enter the passphrase etc. If you want to keep your key more secure then give them value otherwise press enter just to keep them default.After finishing the steps two keys will be generated inside the directory. They are id_rsa.pub and id_rsa . Here id_rsa.pub is your public key and this key should be shared between your pc and server but id_rsa is your private key and this shouldn't be shared rather keep it in only inside your pc.

step-02 :  scp id_rsa.pub rumanB@10.5.20.38:/home/rumanB/.ssh/uploaded_key.pub

scp (secure copy) command in Linux system is used to copy file (s) between servers in a secure way. The SCP command or secure copy allows secure transferring of files in between the local host and the remote host or between two remote hosts.

This command will copy the public key from your local machine and then go to remote server 10.5.20.38 with the username rumanB and navigate to home/rumanB/.ssh and create a file named uploaded_key.pub and then paste the key there. After pressing enter terminal will ask for password . 

step-03 : cat uploaded_key.pub >> authorized_keys

There is a file named authorized_keys into that server /home/rumanB/.ssh . If there is no such file then create it and then run the command.  

This command will read the content from uploaded_key.pub then paste the content into authorized_keys.

Now when you will try to communicate to remote server using ssh then remote server will get your public key at the time of sending request. As remote server is aware of your public key mentioned in authorized_keys so it will give you access to the server.
